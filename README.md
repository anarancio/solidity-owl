### Future steps

1) Complete the following sections

* Events
* Transactions: get the transaction info by hash, show event when a transaction is confirmed or cancelled.
* Blocks: get information about a specific block (events, transactions) or block range.
* Contract: general information about the contract, latest block, storage variables.
* Addresses

2) Improve UI/UX

3) Add the possibility to watch multiple contracts
